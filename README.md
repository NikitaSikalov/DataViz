# Algorithms of data visualization

## Tree visualization

You can find out code and examples in colab notebook.

We use `Layered-Tree-Drawing` algorithm to visualize our trees. You can see its pseudocode on the sreenshot below.

This screenshot was taken from [paper](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy583/papers/ch8.pdf) where you can find some more interesting algorithms of tree visualization.

In our implementation we use [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for visualization and also [networkx](https://networkx.org/) lib for loading and parsing graphs in [GraphML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML) format.
